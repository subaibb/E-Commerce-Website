this's the first ever website that i work on , my objective in this project was to make a responsive design , with a few interactions that can be made , make a simple authentication
to allow a user login , and make roles for and permissions only for admins , i understand some things are not implemented in the website such as the filters or a search bar , i really didn't want to waste 
too much time on it cause my only objective to just make a simple website with a responsive design , the code might be a bit clunky and you may face some issues in the website , im still in my early stages of learning,
hopefully this helps you out in any way , wish me a goodluck in my journey :) .
